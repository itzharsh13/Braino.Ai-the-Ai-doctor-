## 🔧 Configuration

### Email Verification Setup

For email verification to work, you need to set up environment variables:

**For Gmail:**
1. Enable "Less secure app access" in your Google Account
2. Or use an App Password if 2FA is enabled
3. Set environment variables in `.env`:
```
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

**For Other Email Providers:**
Modify the SMTP settings in `auth.py` accordingly.

### API Keys (Optional)
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

If no API key is provided, the app uses intelligent fallback responses.

## 🧠 How the Chatbot Works

1. **Input Processing**: User message is received and logged
2. **Detection**: Check for crisis keywords and inner critic patterns
3. **Response Generation**: Use Gemini AI or fallback to intelligent context-aware responses
4. **Output**: Send response to user and optionally speak it aloud
5. **Tracking**: Log mood, update user stats, and persist data

### Fallback Response System
If the API is unavailable, the bot uses intelligent keyword-based responses for:
- Greetings (hi, hello, hey)
- Anxiety and panic
- Sadness and depression
- Stress and overwhelm
- Sleep issues
- Loneliness
- Self-doubt
- Anger and frustration
- And many more...

## 🔒 Security Notes

⚠️ **Current Implementation:**
- Email passwords stored in environment variables (not encrypted)
- User passwords stored in memory (not hashed)
- No database persistence

⚠️ **For Production:**
- Hash passwords using `bcrypt` or similar
- Use a proper database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Implement JWT tokens for session management
- Use environment-based secrets management
- Enable HTTPS/SSL
- Implement rate limiting
- Add CORS validation

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- Speech Recognition: Chrome, Edge, Safari (some versions)
- Speech Synthesis: All modern browsers
- For best experience, use Chrome or Edge on desktop

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Voice Input Not Working
- Ensure you're using a browser that supports Web Speech API (Chrome/Edge)
- Check microphone permissions
- Restart the browser

### Email Not Sending
- Verify email credentials in `.env`
- Check Gmail app password setup
- Look at console logs for error details

### Chat Not Responding
- Check backend is running (`http://localhost:8000`)
- Verify API configuration in `config.js`
- Check browser console for error messages
